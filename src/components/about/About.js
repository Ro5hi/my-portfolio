            Fueled by caffeine and curiosity. I'm a business school graduate with an interest in technology and software! I studied full stack engineering to enhance my skills in software development. I aim to bring my prior work experiences forward to companies who encourage growth and collaboration. I enjoy my spare time indulging in activities like photography, open-world games, and 3D modeling.
