# My-Portfolio

Deployed onto Netlify!

Portfolio site structured with the following:

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Netlify SSL
- Name.com domain

Icons from FontAwesome!

# Why React.js?

React is a Javascript framework that allows developers like me to build reusable components.

# Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for building responsive websites.

# How did you merge Name and Netlify together?

I bought my domain through Name.com and hosted my site on Netlify. By using Netlify's SSL, my portfolio website has an extra layer of cryptographic security.
